# Casings for 3D printing

## The design

The design is a two-parter, to slide on from the bottom and top. 

The bottom parts is clamps on just by being snug, the top part uses one small pin to latch on one of the holes next to the camera.

Depending on the tolerances of the print, there will be a slight gap between the parts, or it is slightly compressed together.

At the camera/power/volume buttons there is a slight extrusion on the inside, making them slightly pressurised in the default position, making the keypress a little lighter.

Wall thickness is 1.4mm all around, 1mm should be possible but will reduce stiffness so much that the casing will be unstable and unreliable.

Mixing colours does not increase the cost of the order, so please choose some funky combo.

## Material

Shapeways Strong&Flexible Plastic uses Nylon 'dust', fused together with Selective Laser Sintering.

## Shapeways experience

The company is based in the Netherlands and has been my go-to place for printing prototypes and even large batches like TOHKBD. 

My experience with them -compared to similar services- is that they deliver relatively fast, the parts have a very nice surface quality and show little to no warping, for a very reasonable price.

Regarding their match with the Fairphone etics research still has to be done, but being based in the Netherlands I can only assume their employees get very normal wages. Also the SLS process only has the nylon particles as a resource and all non-sintered nylon is fed directly back into the machine, so no unneccessary waste is created.

<dont forget to email shapeways to ask about other stuff and confirm assumptions>

## Colours

#### White
All Shapeways prints start out as a white print. Coloured casings are coated after, which means white casings are produced a lot faster than coloured prints because it does not need this step.
Very white when received, but gets a bit grey and dirty after a while. 
#### Black
Very black. Colour coating is a bit thicker than the other colours, so can be a bit tighter. 
#### Yellow/Orange/Green
Very soft tone. These colours play very well together. 
#### Pink/Red/Purple
Very bright colours, really stand out if you want something a bit more expressive. 
#### Blue
Medium tone. Works well with the black,white,green&yellow. (in my opinion of course!)

### Battery casing

The battery casing has a hump on the back where and extra Fairphone battery fits in to take on the go. There is no extra electronics inside, just to bring extra battery.
