# Reference Design

## What is a reference design?

Or at least how I use it in this case:

In this case I mean I will at some point have fully developed a 3D casing from where I can make adjustments for different applications.

The reference design also includes a set of standard electronic components that are known to work on the hardware-side, but more importantly also play nice with the phone on the software-side.

Having a reference design to start with means that the development of every project has a flying start and more and better projects can be done with less time, less money and less recourses. Everybody wins.

## Current stage

Currently, my reference design is not up to a stage to be shared yet. If you do want to actively help, mail me at dirk@vlman.com.

## Future plans

When I have developed some nice projects and there is a lot of interest from the community to actually want these hardware extensions -or Fairphone is interested to talk business about this- I will fully open all files and documentation I have. The plan is that people with very limited knowledge of electronics will be able to develop their own hardware extensions with a simple set of instructions and guidelines how to do so.

There may also come more than one reference design to meet the needs for different applications.
